# TextBOX-fx

I'm diving into unknwon waters. I'm just a guy who likes to learn stuff, often particularly involving computers.

This project is mostly just a mental exercise to let my ideas flow starting with my basic idea. That idea being "a random animated effect that affects the inputted text."

Anyways, thank you for your interest! This hopefully will help with deving skillz to git gud.

Have a better one! - s u l i
