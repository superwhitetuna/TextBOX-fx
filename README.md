# TextBOX-fx

I'm diving into unknown waters. I'm just a guy who likes to learn stuff, often particularly involving computers.

This project is mostly just a mental exercise to let my ideas flow all starting with a basic idea. That idea being "a random animated effect that affects the inputted text."

Anyways, thank you for your interest! This will hopefully help with deving my skillz to git gud.

Have a better one! - s u l i 🍣
